# Contributing to Gjallarhorn

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Gjallarhorn**! We welcome contributions from everyone. By participating in this project, you help make it better for the entire community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run Heimdall-rs, you need a standard Rust environment and a few system libraries.

1. **Rust**: Install the latest stable Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. **System Libraries** (Linux):
    - `fontconfig` (for Slint font rendering)
    - `libxcb`, `libxkbcommon` (standard GUI deps)
    - *Optional*: NVIDIA Drivers (for GPU monitoring features via `nvml-wrapper`)

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunkumar-mourougappane/heimdall-rs.git
cd heimdall-rs
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

During development, you can run the application in debug mode:

```bash
cargo run
```

**Note**: Debug builds may be slower, especially for chart rendering where thousands of SVG commands are generated. For performance testing, always use release mode:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Code Style & linting

We follow standard Rust community guidelines. Before submitting a PR, please ensure your code is formatted and linted.

1. **Formatting**:

    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```

2. **Linting**:

    ```bash
    cargo clippy
    ```

    Please address any warnings or errors reported by Clippy.
